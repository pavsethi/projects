BigInteger ADT


This program implements a BigInteger ADT in C++ as well as a program to perform the addition, subtration, and multiplication arithmetic on BigIntegers.


The files included are:

BigInteger.cpp --> This file implements the BigInteger ADT

BigInteger.h --> Contains header file for BigInteger.cpp

List.cpp --> This file implements the List ADT

List.h --> Contains header file for List.cpp

Arithmetic.c --> Performs arithmetic operations on BigIntegers

BigIntegerTest.c --> Tests each individual function in BigInteger.cpp

ListTest.c --> Tests each individual function in List.cpp

Makefile --> Creates the executable Shuffle and ListTest

README --> Explains usage of program



Building:

To build the program, run:

...

$ make clean


$ make --> makes BigInteger


$ make BigIntegerTest --> makes BigIntegerTest


$ make ListTest --> makes ListTest

...

Running:


To run the Arithmetic Program:

...

$ ./Arithmetic <input file> <output file>

...

$ ./BigIntegerTet

runs the BigInteger Tests

...

$ ./ListTest

runs the List Tests
