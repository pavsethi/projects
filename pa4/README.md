PA 4 - Matrix ADT


This program implements a Matrix ADT as well as a program to perform Matrix operations


The files included are:

Matrix.c --> This file implements the Matrix ADT

Matrix.h --> Contains header file for Matrix.c

List.c --> Implements List ADT

List.h --> Contains header file for List.C

Sparse.c --> Takes in entries for A and B matrices and performs operations

MatrixTest.c --> Tests each individual functions in Matrix.c

ListTest.c --> Tests each individual function in List.c

Makefile --> Creates the executable FindPath and GraphTest

README --> Explains usage of program



Building:

To build the program, run:

...

$ make clean


$ make --> makes Sparse


$ make MatrixTest --> makes MatrixTest

...

Running:


To run the Sparse Program:

...

$ ./Sparse <input file> <output file>


Commands:

input file is any text file


output file will show Matrix Operations


...

$ ./MatrixTest

runs the Matrix Tests


$ ./List

runs the List Tests
